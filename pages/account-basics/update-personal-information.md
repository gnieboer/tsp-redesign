# Update your personal information

How you change your address with us depends on whether or not you still work for the federal government.

If you’re currently a federal employee, report your correct address to your agency or service. We can’t accept address changes directly from you.

If you’re no longer a federal employee, visit [My Account: Profile Settings](#) to change the address. Or while you’re logged in, use our [Form TSP-9](/PDF/forms/tsp-9.pdf), *Change in Address for Separated Participants*, and fax or mail it to us.

If you’re an active duty uniformed services member, update your address through the myPay website. Just make sure that you log in and go to the TSP section to change your TSP address. If you change it in the “Correspondence Address” section of myPay, it will not change your TSP address.

To change or validate your contact information such as your phone number or email address, visit [My Account: Profile Settings](#).
