# How the TSP fits into my retirement package

If you’re covered by the [Federal Employees' Retirement System](#glossary) (FERS), the TSP is one part of a three-part retirement package that also includes your FERS basic annuity and Social Security.

If you’re covered by the [Civil Service Retirement System](#glossary) (CSRS) or are a member of the [uniformed services](#glossary), the TSP is a supplement to your CSRS annuity or military retired pay.

Not sure which retirement system you are covered under? Check with your personnel or benefits office.

## Participant eligibility

Most employees of the United States government are eligible to participate in the Thrift Savings Plan (TSP). You are eligible if you’re:

- A Federal Employees' Retirement System (FERS) employee (generally if you were hired on or after January 1, 1984), or
- A Civil Service Retirement System (CSRS) employee (generally if you were hired before January 1, 1984 and did not convert to FERS), or
- A member of the uniformed services (active duty or Ready Reserve), or
- A civilian in certain other categories of government service

In addition to being covered by an eligible retirement system, you must also be:

- Actively employed by the federal government as a civilian employee or as a member of the uniformed services,
- In a pay status, in order to contribute, and
- Working full- or part-time.

## Establishing Your TSP account

### FERS employees

If you’re a FERS employee hired after July 31, 2010, your agency has automatically enrolled you in the TSP and 3% of your basic pay is deducted each pay period and deposited in the traditional balance of your TSP account.

If you’re a FERS employee hired before August 1, 2010, you already have a TSP account with accruing Agency/Service Automatic (1%) Contributions. In addition, you can make contributions to your account from your pay and receive Agency/Service Matching Contributions.

To make a contribution election, use your agency’s electronic payroll system (e.g., Employee Express) or complete and submit [Form TSP-1](/PDF/forms/tsp-1.pdf), *Election Form*.

### CSRS employees
If you’re a CSRS employee, your account is established by your agency after you make a contribution election using your agency's electronic payroll system (e.g., Employee Express) or complete and submit [Form TSP-1](/PDF/forms/tsp-1.pdf), *Election Form*.

### BRS members of the uniformed services

If you’re a member of the uniformed services who began serving on or after January 1, 2018, your service automatically enrolled you in the TSP (or will) once you had served 60 days and 3% of your basic pay is deducted from your paycheck each pay period and deposited in the traditional balance of your TSP account.

### Non-BRS members of the uniformed services

If you’re a member of the uniformed services who is not covered by the Blended Retirement System (BRS), your account is established by your service after you make a contribution election using your service's electronic payroll system (e.g., myPay), or complete and submit [Form TSP-U-1](/PDF/forms/tsp-u-1.pdf), *Election Form*.

### Rehired FERS and CSRS employees

If you’re a FERS or CSRS employee rehired after July 31, 2010, your agency has automatically enrolled you in the TSP, and 3% of your basic pay is deducted from your paycheck each pay period and deposited in the traditional balance of your TSP account.

### Reentering members of the uniformed services

If you were already in the BRS plan before you left the service—whether as a new member of the uniformed services or an opt-in—you will be automatically reenrolled when you reenter. If you were not in BRS but had fewer than 12 years of service when you left, your service may give you the opportunity to opt in when you reenter. In either case, assuming you had served 60 days before leaving, your enrollment will begin with the first pay period after reentering. If neither situation applies to you, you can still start a TSP account or resume contributing to your existing account as a non-BRS member.
