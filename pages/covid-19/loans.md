## Definitions and eligibility
To be eligible for the CARES Act loan options, you must be a **qualified individual**. You’re a qualified individual if you meet at least one of the following criteria listed in the CARES Act. When you apply for either loan option, you are self-certifying that you meet one or more of these conditions. To protect your privacy, do NOT send supporting documentation with your application, especially medical information.

- You are or have been diagnosed with the virus SARS–CoV–2 or with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID–19) by a test approved by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (including a test authorized under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act).
- Your spouse or dependent (as defined in section 152 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986) is or has been diagnosed with such virus or disease by such a test.
- Due to COVID-19, you are experiencing adverse financial consequences as a result of you, your spouse, or a member of your - -

  - being unable to work due to lack of child care;
  - having to close or reduce hours of a business;
  - having a reduction in pay or self-employment income; or
  - having a job offer rescinded or a start date for a job delayed.


## Increased maximum loan amount
The maximum loan amount on a general purpose loan is increased from $50,000 to $100,000, and the portion of your available balance you can borrow is raised from 50% to 100%. **All of the other rules on TSP loans apply, including that you may not have more than one general purpose loan at the same time. A loan with the increased maximum amount allowed under the CARES Act is still a general purpose loan**. To apply, [log in to My Account and use the online tool]({{ site.loans }}). The deadline for applying is September 22, 2020.

## Temporary suspension of loan payments
You may suspend your obligation to make payments on your TSP loan or loans for the rest of calendar year 2020. This applies to existing loans and loans taken between now and November 30, 2020. To apply, complete and submit [Form TSP-46]({{ site.baseurl }}/forms/tsp-46.pdf), _CARES Act Loan Suspension Request_. Carefully read all of the instructions on the form before submitting.

If you are planning to apply for a loan now or in the near future, apply for the loan first and wait for it to be processed before submitting Form TSP-46. Do this whether or not you have an existing loan.<sup>1</sup> **Filing Form TSP-46 at the same time as you apply for loan or at any time before your loan application is processed may cause your loan application to be rejected**. If you have two loans when you file Form TSP-46, the payment suspension will apply to both of them.
