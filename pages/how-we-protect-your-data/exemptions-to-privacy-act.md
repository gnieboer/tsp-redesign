# Exemptions to the privacy act

Under subsection (k) of the Privacy Act, 5 U.S.C. 552a, investigatory material compiled for law enforcement purposes in the following systems is exempt from certain Privacy Act requirements: [FRTIB-2 (Personnel Security Investigation Files)](#), [FRTIB-13 (Fraud and Forgery Records)](#), [FRTIB-14 (FRTIB Legal Case Files)](#), [FRTIB-15 (Internal Investigations of Harassment and Hostile Work Environment Allegations)](#).

If, however, you are denied any right, privilege, or benefit that you would otherwise be entitled to by federal law, or for which you would otherwise be eligible, as a result of the maintenance of these records, the material will be provided to you except to the extent that the disclosure of the material would reveal the identity of a source who furnished information to the Government with an express promise of confidentiality. See [55 Fed. Reg. 18851, 18856 (May 7, 1990)](https://www.govinfo.gov/app/details/FR-1990-05-07){:target="\_blank"}.
