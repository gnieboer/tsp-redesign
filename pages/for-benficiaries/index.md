# For beneficiaries

### How do I notify the TSP of a participant’s death?

If you are the next-of-kin or legal representative of a deceased TSP participant, you should notify the TSP __immediately__ in the event of their death. You can do this in one of two ways:

+ If the participant was an active Federal employee or member of the uniformed services, report the death to the participant's employing agency or service.
+ Otherwise, report the participant's death to the TSP by calling 1-877-968-3778. Press 3 from the main menu and hold to speak to a TSP Service Representative.
