# Change your investments

To change which fund(s) you invest in, there are two transactions you can make:

 A [contribution allocation](#) tells us how you want to invest NEW money coming into your account.

An [interfund transfer ](#)(IFT) allows you to change the way money ALREADY in your account is invested.

You are allowed two IFTs in a calendar month. After that, you can only transfer money into the G Fund.

You may request a contribution allocation or an IFT by visiting [Online Transactions.] You can also call the ThriftLine at 1-877-968-3778 and follow the automated prompts.
