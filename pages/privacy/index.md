# FRTIB Privacy Division

## Who we are

The Federal Retirement Thrift Investment Board (FRTIB or Agency) is an independent Government agency that administers the Thrift Savings Plan (TSP). FRTIB’s privacy program is led by FRTIB’s Senior Agency Official for Privacy (SAOP) and is run by the Privacy Division within FRTIB’s Office of General Counsel (OGC).

## Our mission

The mission of the Privacy Division is to preserve and enhance privacy protections for all individuals who entrust their personal information to FRTIB by embedding privacy protections throughout all of FRTIB’s activities. The Privacy Division implements the requirements of the [Privacy Act of 1974, *as amended*](https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/USCODE-2016-title5/pdf/USCODE-2016-title5-partI-chap5-subchapII-sec552a.pdf target="\_blank"); the [E-Government Act of 2002](https://www.congress.gov/107/plaws/publ347/PLAW-107publ347.pdf target="\_blank"); and the [Federal Information Security Modernization Act (FISMA)](https://www.congress.gov/113/plaws/publ283/PLAW-113publ283.pdf target="\_blank"), as well as policy directives and best practices issued in furtherance of those Acts.

The Privacy Division adheres to the policy framework embodied in the Fair Information Practice Principles (FIPPs) to ensure that individual privacy is protected throughout the collection, maintenance, use, and dissemination of all personally identifiable information (PII) maintained by FRTIB. The FIPPs consist of the following five core principles:

- Notice/Awareness;
- Choice/Consent;
- Access/Participation;
- Integrity/Security; and
- Enforcement/Redress.
