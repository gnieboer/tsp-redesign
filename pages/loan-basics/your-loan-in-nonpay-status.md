# Your loan in a nonpay status

<p markdown="1">If you’re in an approved <span data-term="Nonpay Status" class="js-glossary-toggle term term-end">nonpay status</span> and you have provided the proper documentation to us, the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) regulations allow us to suspend loan payments for up to 1 year.  Once you return to <span data-term="Pay Status" class="js-glossary-toggle term term-end">pay status</span>, your payroll-deducted loan payments will resume. Your loan will be reamortized automatically when your agency or service notifies us that you have returned to pay status. For more information, please refer to the Fact Sheet, [Effect of Nonpay Status on Your TSP Account]({{ site.baseurl }}/publications/tspfs04.pdf).</p>

## Suspension of loan payments
If you’re a civilian who goes into nonpay status to perform military service:
+ The suspension of loan payments may continue for the duration of your military service.
+ You cannot repay your civilian loan by making loan deductions from your uniformed services pay.
+ Your loan accrues interest while your payments are suspended.
+ If you’d like to make payments, you can send a personal check or money order along with the [Loan Payment Coupon]({{ site.baseurl }}/forms/tsp-26/) to continue making loan payments. Your payments will be taken into account when the loan is reamortized once you return to pay status.

If you’re in nonpay status for reasons other than active military service:
+ The maximum period that we can suspend your loan payments is one year.
+ If your nonpay period exceeds one year, your loan will be automatically reamortized and you must make payments from your personal funds to avoid being in default.
+ Your loan accrues interest while your payments are suspended.
+ If you’d like to make payments, you can send a personal check or money order along with the [Loan Payment Coupon]({{ site.baseurl }}/forms/tsp-26/) to continue making loan payments. Your payments will be taken into account when the loan is reamortized once you return to pay status.

## Notifying the TSP of your nonpay status
When you begin your period of nonpay status, you or your agency or service must submit one of the following forms to us:
+ [Form TSP-41]({{ site.baseurl }}/forms/tsp-41.pdf), _Notification to TSP of Nonpay Status_
+ Form SF-50, Notification of Personnel Action
+ A letter on agency or service letterhead, signed by an appropriate agency official or your commander or adjutant, that contains your name, date of birth, and Social Security number; the beginning date of the nonpay status; and the signature and title of the agency or service representative providing the information
+ A copy of your military orders

## Returning from nonpay status
When you return from nonpay status, you must notify us of your date of return. You can use any type of documentation described in the above section. Once your agency or service notifies us of your return, your loan will be reamortized to place it in good standing.

**Note:** If your agency reports you as separated from civilian service to perform military service, you must repay your loan in full within 90 days. If you don't, the outstanding loan balance and any unpaid interest will be reported to the IRS as a taxable distribution.

## Leaving federal service
When you leave federal service, you must repay your loan in full within 90 days after your separation is reported to us. Your repayment must include any accrued interest on the outstanding principal balance.
If you do not repay your loan in full, a taxable distribution of the outstanding balance of your loan will be declared. If that happens, you may be able to roll the amount of the distribution into an IRA or eligible employer plan within 60 days to avoid taxes and penalties.

If any part of your loan is associated with tax-exempt contributions or qualified Roth contributions, those contributions will not be subject to tax; however, Roth earnings that are not qualified will be subject to tax.

If you’ve left federal service, you will not be able to withdraw your TSP account unless your loan is closed by either payment in full or taxable distribution.
