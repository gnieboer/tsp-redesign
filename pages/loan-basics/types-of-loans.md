## How a TSP loan works 

When you take a loan, you borrow from your TSP account. The amount of your loan cannot exceed the amount of your own contributions and earnings from those contributions. So, if you work under the Federal Employees' Retirement System (FERS), you cannot borrow from any agency contributions or earnings from those contributions.
 
If you meet the loan eligibility rules and your loan request is approved, the loan amount is removed from your TSP account. You must repay your loan with interest. Repayments for the loan and interest are generally made through payroll deductions. Your repayments restore the amount of your loan, plus interest, to your account.

For additional information, visit [Repaying your loan](repaying-your-loan.md).
