# Economic hardship

Having the option of taking an in-service withdrawal from your TSP account can be a lifesaver when you’re facing a financial hardship. But before you do, evaluate your options carefully and know the consequences.

- **It's a permanent withdrawal from your TSP account.** You can’t put the money back. Furthermore, it reduces the amount of money that grows and generates compound earnings.
- **Your TSP contributions are suspended for 6 months.** This means 6 months of forgone retirement savings, tax deferral, and compound earnings. Also, your contributions will not resume automatically after the 6-month period; you’ll have to make a new contribution election.
- **Agency/Service Matching Contributions are suspended.** FERS and BRS participants will not receive Agency/Service Matching Contributions again until you are eligible to resume contributions and you've completed another election form.

### Tax Considerations

- **We’ll withhold 10% on the taxable portion of your withdrawal for federal income tax.** You have the option of increasing or waiving this withholding.
- **The taxable portion of your withdrawal is subject to federal income tax at your ordinary rate.** Also, you may have to pay state income tax.
- **An additional IRS early withdrawal penalty of 10% may apply** if you're under the age of 59½.

### Spousal Rights

- **If you’re a FERS employees or a uniformed services member**, a financial hardship withdrawal requires your spouse's notarized consent.
- **If you’re a CSRS employee**, a financial hardship withdrawal requires spouse notification.
