# Start, change, or stop contributions

In most cases, you'll use your agency's or service's electronic payroll system to start, change, or stop your TSP contributions.

For example, civilian payroll systems include [Employee Express]({{ site.baseurl }}/exit/?idx=7){:rel="nofollow"}, EBIS/GRB, [LiteBlue]({{ site.baseurl }}/exit/?idx=8){:rel="nofollow"}, [myPay]({{ site.baseurl }}/exit/?idx=6){:rel="nofollow"}, and [NFC EPP]({{ site.baseurl }}/exit/?idx=9){:rel="nofollow"}.

Uniformed services can use [myPay]({{ site.baseurl }}/exit/?idx=6){:rel="nofollow"} (Army, Air Force, Navy, Marine Corps) or [Direct Access]({{ site.baseurl }}/exit/?idx=47){:rel="nofollow"} (Coast Guard and NOAA Corps).

## I was just hired. Am I already contributing?

If you're a brand new employee of the federal government or uniformed services, you were automatically enrolled in the TSP at 3% of your salary. Many people who were automatically enrolled decide to increase their contributions to at least 5% of their salary to [get the full match]({{ site.baseurl }}/making-contributions/maximize-your-savings/) from their agency or service.

<!--  full match should link to "How do I get the full match?" page -->
