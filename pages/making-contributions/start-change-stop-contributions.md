# How to start, change, and stop contributions

In most cases, you'll use your agency's or service's electronic payroll system to change, stop, or start your TSP contributions.

For example, civilian payroll systems include [Employee Express](https://www.employeeexpress.gov/Default.aspx){:target="\_blank"}, [myPay](https://mypay.dfas.mil/mypay.aspx){:target="\_blank"}, [LiteBlue](https://liteblue.usps.gov/wps/portal/!ut/p/z1/jY9NC4JAEIZ_SweP60zaF92kQxF9EGLaXEJhWxfWXdHV6N8ndSiir7m9M8888AJBAqTTVorUSqNT1eUDjY6zebAYjFeIW2-P6G2G4Q6j0Md1H-IbgB8mQKB__r8A9F0fA_1ClkBCmezeJtCZPxFAFT_xilduU3Xr3NqynjrooJKWZ6rhbsEfgSkjpGZGK6k5a-qyZi8nYVoH3-lzU1tInqxQFlGCjLLLOehdAUrfAgc!/dz/d5/L2dBISEvZ0FBIS9nQSEh/){:target="\_blank"}, EBIS, and [NFC EPP](https://www.nfc.usda.gov/EPPS/eplogin.aspx){:target="\_blank"}.

Uniformed services can use myPay (Army, Air Force, Navy, Marine Corps) or Direct Access (Coast Guard and NOAA Corps).

## I was just hired. Am I already contributing?

If you are a brand new employee of the federal government or uniformed services, you were automatically enrolled in the TSP at 3% of your salary. Many people who were automatically enrolled decide to increase their contributions to at least 5% of their salary to [get the full match](#) from their agency or service.
