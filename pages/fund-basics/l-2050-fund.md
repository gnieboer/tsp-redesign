# L 2050 Fund
## Lifecycle Funds

**First, let’s answer a few questions:**

**Q1: Why should I invest in the L 2050 Fund?**

A1: TSP participants who will withdraw their money beginning 2045 or later should consider investing in the L 2050 Fund.

**Q2: Am I ok with market and inflation risk?**

A2: When you invest in the L 2050 Fund, you are subject to the investment risks associated with the G, F, C, S, and I funds. This means that the L 2050 Fund can have periods of gain and loss, just as the individual TSP funds do. 

**Q3: How can I use the L 2050 Fund in my TSP Account?**

A3: Your investment in the L 2050 Fund will help you to achieve the best expected return for the amount of expected risk that is appropriate for your time horizon. The L 2050 Fund makes the investing process easy for you because you do not have to figure out how to diversify your account or how and when to rebalance - it’s done for you. 

**Fund overview (Objective):**

The L 2050 Fund’s investment objective is to achieve a high level of growth with a very low emphasis on preservation of assets. The Fund's allocation in the G, F, C, S, and I Funds is adjusted quarterly. The L 2050 will roll into the L Income Fund automatically in July 2050 when its allocation becomes the same as the allocation of the L Income Fund.

*An expense ratio of .033% translates to 3.3 basis points or $0.33 per $1,000 account balance.

**Fees associated with securities lending are not included in 2017 administrative expenses. Consistent with standard practice in the industry, they are charged in addition to administrative
expenses. The other expenses represent fees paid to the investment manager for administering securities lending programs. Income earned from these programs improved the returns of the fund.

**Additional Information:**

The L 2050 is designed for TSP participants with time horizons that fall within the 2045 or later range. The asset allocation of this fund is adjusted quarterly, moving to a more conservative mix, gradually approaching that of the L Income Fund. Between quarterly adjustments, the asset allocation of the L 2050 is maintained through daily rebalancing to the fund’s target allocation. 

Remember, however, that expected risk and return are based on assumptions about future economic conditions and investment performance. There is no guaranteed rate of return for any period, either short-term or long-term. For the L 2050’s historical returns, visit “Learn about fund options” at tsp.gov. Past performance does not guarantee future results.
