# Expense Ratio
Running the TSP involves many necessary expenses. Because of our size, we're able to save you money by keeping our expenses very low. For example, by saving in the TSP, you'll pay 20% less in fees after 25 years than you would in the average IRA. __For 2017, the average TSP net expense for participants was $.033* for every $1,000 invested.__

The gross expenses include:

* The costs of operating and maintaining the TSP's recordkeeping system,
* The cost of providing participant services, and
* The printing and mailing of notices, statements, and publications.

These expenses are paid by the forfeitures of Agency/Service Automatic (1%) Contributions of FERS and BRS participants who leave federal service before they are vested, other forfeitures, and loan fees. Because these amounts are not sufficient to cover all of the expenses, participants share in the remainder of the costs.

The net expense ratio represents the amount that your investment returns were reduced by TSP administrative expenses.

Expense ratios may also be expressed in basis points. One basis point is 1/100th of one percent, or .01%. Therefore, the 2017 TSP net expense ratio* of .033% is 3.3 basis points. Either way, this means that expenses charged to each TSP account in 2017 were approximately 33 cents per $1,000 of investment.

*Fees associated with securities lending are not included in 2017 administrative expenses. Consistent with standard practice in the industry, they are charged in addition to administrative expenses. Other expenses are disclosed in the financial statements and are available in the April 2018 [*Highlights.*](https://www.tsp.gov/forms/newsletterArchive.html)
