# Economic hardship
 
Having the option of taking an in-service withdrawal from your TSP account can be a lifesaver when you’re facing a financial hardship. But before you do, evaluate your options carefully and know the consequences.
 
* **It's a permanent withdrawal from your TSP account.** You can’t put the money back. Furthermore, it reduces the amount of money that grows and generates compound earnings.

* **Your TSP contributions are suspended for 6 months.** This means 6 months of forgone retirement savings, tax deferral, and compound earnings. Also, your contributions will not resume automatically after the 6-month period; you’ll have to make a new contribution election.

* **Agency/Service Matching Contributions are suspended.** FERS and BRS participants will not receive Agency/Service Matching Contributions again until you are eligible to resume contributions and you've completed another election form.

## Tax considerations
* **We’ll withhold 10% on the taxable portion of your withdrawal for federal income tax.** You have the option of increasing or waiving this withholding.

* **The taxable portion of your withdrawal is subject to federal income tax at your ordinary rate.** Also, you may have to pay state income tax.

* **An additional IRS early withdrawal penalty of 10% may apply** if you're under the age of 59½.

## Spousal rights
 * **If you’re a FERS employees or a uniformed services member,** a financial hardship withdrawal requires your spouse's notarized consent.
 
* **If you’re a CSRS employee,** a financial hardship withdrawal requires spouse notification.
