# Start an annuity
 
## Step one
Before completing the necessary forms to purchase your annuity, you should read the booklet, [Withdrawing Your TSP Account After Leaving Federal Service](#). **Once your request has been processed and your balance is removed from your account, you cannot cancel the annuity.**
## Step two
If you have determined that an annuity is appropriate for your needs, you should complete [Form TSP-70](#), _Request for Full Withdrawal_. Be sure to read the form and instructions carefully as they outline specific requirements that you must meet in order to avoid any unnecessary delays in processing. Keep in mind that there is a $3,500 minimum amount required to purchase an annuity. If you are using only a portion of your account for an annuity, the percentage of your account that you choose when requesting it must equal $3,500 or more of your vested account balance.

If you have both a traditional balance and a Roth balance in your TSP account, the $3,500 minimum threshold applies to each balance separately. However, you cannot choose different annuities for each type of balance. We will purchase two identical annuities - one with each balance.

## Step three
After we receive all of the information and documentation necessary to purchase your annuity, it may take up to several weeks to process your request and disburse your funds.
Your annuity will be purchased from our annuity provider. The annuity provider is competitively chosen by the [Federal Retirement Thrift Investment Board](frtib.gov), the agency that administers the TSP.

Once the funds for your annuity have been disbursed, you cannot cancel your annuity, change your annuity option, or change your joint annuitant.

## Step four
Once the money has left your account, you should direct all communications concerning your annuity to the annuity provider. The provider will send you a package of information and an annuity contract. Your monthly annuity payments will begin approximately one month after the annuity is purchased.
