The Federal Retirement Thrift Investment Board (Board) has revised the Thrift Savings Plan
(TSP) Election Form (TSP-U-1) and Catch-up Contribution Election Form (TSP-U-1-C) for elections submitted by TSP members for the beginning of 2012. The TSP-U-1 is revised to reflect the increase to the Internal Revenue Code (IRC) annual elective deferral limit to $17,000 in 2012. This revision also reflects the increase to the IRC annual additions limit to $50,000 in 2012. The TSP-U-1-C is revised to reflect the same catch-up limit of $5,500 for 2012.
