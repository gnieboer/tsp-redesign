The Federal Retirement Thrift Investment Board (Agency) has made a number of changes to the TSP financial hardship in-service withdrawal process to provide for notarized spouse and participant signatures and to reduce the number of forms rejected because they are incomplete or invalid. Changes include the consolidation of Forms TSP-76, Financial Hardship In-Service Withdrawal Request (Civilian) and TSP-U-76 (uniformed services) into a single form, effective December 12, 2011. The combined form supercedes all prior versions of the Financial Hardship In-Service Withdrawal Request. Previous versions of the form must be discarded (recycled), and agencies/services that provide links to electronic versions of old forms should disable those links. Previous versions will not be processed. A copy of the consolidated Form TSP-76 is attached to this bulletin. The revised Form TSP-76 is available for download from the TSP website.
