The Federal Retirement Thrift Investment Board (Agency) has consolidated Form TSP-60,
Request For A Transfer Into The TSP (civilian) and Form TSP-U-60 (uniformed services)
into a single form, effective May 7, 2012. The combined form supersedes all prior versions
of Forms TSP-60 and TSP-U-60 with dates prior to April 2012. Previous versions of the form
must be immediately discarded (recycled), and agencies/services that provide links to electronic versions of the old forms should disable those links. Previous versions will not be
processed after June 1, 2012. A copy of the new consolidated Form TSP-60 is attached to
this bulletin. It is also available for download from the TSP website.
