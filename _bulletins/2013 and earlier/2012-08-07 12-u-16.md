The Thrift Savings Plan Enhancement Act of 2009, Public Law 111-31, signed into law on
June 22, 2009, authorized the Thrift Savings Plan (TSP) to add a Roth feature to the plan.
This benefit allows participants to contribute on an after-tax basis to their TSP accounts and
receive tax-free earnings when they withdraw the funds (assuming certain Internal Revenue
Service criteria are met). To accommodate the Roth contribution, transfer, and withdrawal
features, the TSP has developed new forms and declared prior versions of these forms obsolete. When feasible, the obsolete forms were replaced with forms combined for the use of
both civilian and uniformed services participants.
