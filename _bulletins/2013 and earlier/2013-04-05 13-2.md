In support of Financial Literacy Month, April 2013, the TSP is pleased to announce the publication of a special poster, “Now is the right time to save.” A recent study quoted in the Journal of Financial Planning found that only 16% of Americans included financial planning in their New Year’s resolutions for 2013, down from 20% in 2012 and 33% in 2009.
