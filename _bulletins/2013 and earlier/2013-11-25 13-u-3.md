The Internal Revenue Service (IRS) has announced the contribution limits for 2014: These limits affect the amount of contributions participants can make to the Thrift Savings Plan (TSP) for the year. TSP contributions are reported by pay date, which is established by the participant’s employing agency and represents the date employees receive payment for a particular pay period. The pay date determines the year for which contributions are applied to the IRS contribution limits, and may be different than the date on which contributions are actually received and posted to the account.
