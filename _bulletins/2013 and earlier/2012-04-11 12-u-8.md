The Thrift Savings Plan Enhancement Act of 2009, Public Law 111-31, signed into law on
June 22, 2009, authorized the Thrift Savings Plan (TSP) to add a Roth feature to the plan.
This benefit allows participants to contribute on an after-tax basis to their TSP accounts and
receive tax-free earnings when they withdraw the funds (assuming certain criteria are met).
The Roth TSP feature is similar to private sector Roth 401(k) plans. (The rules governing Roth
401(k) plans differ from those governing Roth individual retirement arrangements (IRAs).)
