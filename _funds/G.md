  - question: Am I ok with market and inflation risk?
    answer: The G Fund is subject to the possibility that your investment will not grow enough to offset the reduction in purchasing power that results from inflation (<span data-term="Inflation Risk" class="js-glossary-toggle term term-end">inflation risk</span>).
  - question: How can I use the G Fund in my TSP?
    answer: Consider investing in the G Fund if you would like to have all or a portion of your TSP account completely protected from loss.

  The G Fund rate is calculated by the U.S.
  Treasury as the weighted average yield of
  approximately 136 U.S. Treasury securities
  on the last day of the previous month.
additional_info: |
  The G Fund is invested in short-term U.S. Treasury securities specially issued to the TSP. Payment of principal and interest is guaranteed by the U.S. government. Thus, there is no “credit risk.”

  Although the securities in the G Fund earn a long-term interest rate, the Board’s investment in the G Fund is redeemable on any business day with no risk to principal. The value of  G Fund securities does not fluctuate; only the interest rate changes.

  The G Fund Yield Advantage—The G Fund rate calculation results in a long-term rate being earned on short-term securities. Because long-term interest rates are generally higher than short-term rates, G Fund securities usually earn a higher rate of return than do short-term marketable Treasury securities.
