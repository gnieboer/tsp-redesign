This will depend on how often you are paid (biweekly or monthly, for example). If you are uncertain, check with your personnel or finance office.

<tbody>
<tr><td>Biweekly</td><td>26*</td></tr>
<tr><td>Monthly</td><td>12</td></tr>
<tr><td>Weekly</td><td>52</td></tr>
<tr><td>Semimonthly</td><td>24</td></tr>

\*A biweekly frequency occasionally results in 27 salary payments for a year.  Contact your personnel or payroll office if you do not know the number of salary payments you will receive for the remainder of the year.
